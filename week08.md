### Week 08 at CodeFellows

 > Only 2 weeks till the end. I cannot believe that its almost done. We have covered so much material but there's still so much to learn. I really enjoyed Brian's SASS lecture and I agree with him 100% that you can't call yourself web/soft dev and not being able to style your product. I think we got a really good idea for final project. I will be a tool for teachers to get instant conformation from students about subject they are teaching. We feel that knowing where your class is and how much they comprehend lectures is the most crucial thing for any instuctor. Thinking of implementing voting system, opening issues, chat, pop quiz and scoreboarding.
