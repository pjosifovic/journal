### Third week at CodeFellows

* Let's see - in this previous week we covered a lot of useful topics some of them that we will implement in almost all our projects. We are finally starting to get to work with express, mongo and mongoose as well and working with our database and performing basic CRUD operations. Working with models and establishing relationship between them. I would say that was the most interesting part of the week. Working with database is something that I'm very interested. Excited to see how we can achive many to many relationship in mongodb. I think I have a good grip of what mongoose is doing behind the scenes but sometimes it's really hard to understand why they used that specific syntax. ORM context is great but mongoose docs are just not the best. 

* This week we got our mid term grops and started thinking about the project that we want to take. Still not really sure about what are the requirements for it and it would be nice to go over that with Vinicio. I think right now the group is leaning towards non profit volunteer managment system. It's really hard to think about some idea for the project that doesnt have user interface and do all that in the middle of the week with all lab and reading assignments. Definately, working on non profit volunteer project would be great because we will get to work directly for the client so we can experiance that and it can be something that we can complete and focus after finishing the course. 


## Friday data structures

* This week we learned about binary tree and different methods to traverse though nodes in BT. We learned terms like: `leaf`, `height`, `depth` and used in-order, pre-order and post-order methods to traverse binary tree. Looking forward to binary search tree next week.
