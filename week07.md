### Week 07 at CodeFellows

 > This week was relatively easy - we did introduced Redux and fair amount of new terms like (`store`, `reducer`, `action`, `type`, `payload`, `dispatch`, `provider`). Making flash cards and doing more research and tutorials online helped me understand the beauty of Redux and its powers. Depending on complexity of our app, we would decide if we need to use Redux or we will be passing and dealing with state in each component. Next week we will have to start thinking about our final project - and maybe start working on front end for Volly.
